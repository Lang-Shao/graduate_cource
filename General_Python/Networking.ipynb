      "\n",
      "   There is coffee all over the world. Increasingly, in a world in which\n",
      "   computing is ubiquitous, the computists want to make coffee. Coffee\n",
      "   brewing is an art, but the distributed intelligence of the web-\n",
      "   connected world transcends art.  Thus, there is a strong, dark, rich\n",
      "   requirement for a protocol designed espressoly for the brewing of\n",
      "   coffee. Coffee is brewed using coffee pots.  Networked coffee pots\n",
      "   require a control protocol if they are to be controlled.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Increasingly, home and consumer devices are being connected to the\n",
      "   Internet. Early networking experiments demonstrated vending devices\n",
      "   connected to the Internet for status monitoring [COKE]. One of the\n",
      "   first remotely _operated_ machine to be hooked up to the Internet,\n",
      "   the Internet Toaster, (controlled via SNMP) was debuted in 1990\n",
      "   [RFC2235].\n",
      "\n",
      "   The demand for ubiquitous appliance connectivity that is causing the\n",
      "   consumption of the IPv4 address space. Consumers want remote control\n",
      "   of devices such as coffee pots so that they may wake up to freshly\n",
      "   brewed coffee, or cause coffee to be prepared at a precise time after\n",
      "   the completion of dinner preparations.\n",

      "\n",
      "   The HTCPCP protocol is built on top of HTTP, with the addition of a\n",
      "   few new methods, header fields and return codes.  All HTCPCP servers\n",
      "   should be referred to with the \"coffee:\" URI scheme (Section 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1 HTCPCP Added Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1.1 The BREW method, and the use of POST\n",
      "\n",
      "   Commands to control a coffee pot are sent from client to coffee\n",
      "   server using either the BREW or POST method, and a message body with\n",
      "   Content-Type set to \"application/coffee-pot-command\".\n",
      "\n",
      "   A coffee pot server MUST accept both the BREW and POST method\n",
      "   equivalently.  However, the use of POST for causing actions to happen\n",
      "   is deprecated.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Coffee pots heat water using electronic mechanisms, so there is no\n",
      "   fire. Thus, no firewalls are necessary, and firewall control policy\n",
      "   is irrelevant. However, POST may be a trademark for coffee, and so\n",
      "   the BREW method has been added. The BREW method may be used with\n",
      "   other HTTP-based protocols (e.g., the Hyper Text Brewery Control\n",
      "   Protocol).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1.2 GET method\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "   There is coffee all over the world. Increasingly, in a world in which\n",
      "   computing is ubiquitous, the computists want to make coffee. Coffee\n",
      "   brewing is an art, but the distributed intelligence of the web-\n",
      "   connected world transcends art.  Thus, there is a strong, dark, rich\n",
      "   requirement for a protocol designed espressoly for the brewing of\n",
      "   coffee. Coffee is brewed using coffee pots.  Networked coffee pots\n",
      "   require a control protocol if they are to be controlled.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Increasingly, home and consumer devices are being connected to the\n",
      "   Internet. Early networking experiments demonstrated vending devices\n",
      "   connected to the Internet for status monitoring [COKE]. One of the\n",
      "   first remotely _operated_ machine to be hooked up to the Internet,\n",
      "   the Internet Toaster, (controlled via SNMP) was debuted in 1990\n",
      "   [RFC2235].\n",
      "\n",
      "   The demand for ubiquitous appliance connectivity that is causing the\n",
      "   consumption of the IPv4 address space. Consumers want remote control\n",
      "   of devices such as coffee pots so that they may wake up to freshly\n",
      "   brewed coffee, or cause coffee to be prepared at a precise time after\n",
      "   the completion of dinner preparations.\n",

      "\n",
      "2.1.1 The BREW method, and the use of POST\n",
      "\n",
      "   Commands to control a coffee pot are sent from client to coffee\n",
      "   server using either the BREW or POST method, and a message body with\n",

      "\n",
      "   A coffee pot server MUST accept both the BREW and POST method\n",
      "   equivalently.  However, the use of POST for causing actions to happen\n",
      "   is deprecated.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Coffee pots heat water using electronic mechanisms, so there is no\n",
      "   fire. Thus, no firewalls are necessary, and firewall control policy\n",
      "   is irrelevant. However, POST may be a trademark for coffee, and so\n",
      "   the BREW method has been added. The BREW method may be used with\n",
      "   other HTTP-based protocols (e.g., the Hyper Text Brewery Control\n",
      "   Protocol).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1.2 GET method\n",

      "\n",
      "   A robust quality of service is required between the coffee pot user\n",

      "   Protocol [NTP] to synchronize their clocks to a globally accurate\n",

      "\n",
      "   Telerobotics has been an expensive technology. However, with the\n",
      "   advent of the Cambridge Coffee Pot [CAM], the use of the web (rather\n",
      "   than SNMP) for remote system monitoring and management has been\n",
      "   proven.  Additional coffee pot maintenance tasks might be\n",

      "   the server. An image used for robot control or for monitoring a\n",

      "\n",
      "   There is coffee all over the world. Increasingly, in a world in which\n",
      "   computing is ubiquitous, the computists want to make coffee. Coffee\n",
      "   brewing is an art, but the distributed intelligence of the web-\n",
      "   connected world transcends art.  Thus, there is a strong, dark, rich\n",
      "   requirement for a protocol designed espressoly for the brewing of\n",
      "   coffee. Coffee is brewed using coffee pots.  Networked coffee pots\n",
      "   require a control protocol if they are to be controlled.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Increasingly, home and consumer devices are being connected to the\n",
      "   Internet. Early networking experiments demonstrated vending devices\n",
      "   connected to the Internet for status monitoring [COKE]. One of the\n",
      "   first remotely _operated_ machine to be hooked up to the Internet,\n",
      "   the Internet Toaster, (controlled via SNMP) was debuted in 1990\n",
      "   [RFC2235].\n",
      "\n",
      "   The demand for ubiquitous appliance connectivity that is causing the\n",
      "   consumption of the IPv4 address space. Consumers want remote control\n",
      "   of devices such as coffee pots so that they may wake up to freshly\n",
      "   brewed coffee, or cause coffee to be prepared at a precise time after\n",
      "   the completion of dinner preparations.\n",

      "\n",
      "   HTTP 1.1 ([RFC2068]) permits the transfer of web objects from origin\n",
      "   servers to clients. The web is world-wide.  HTCPCP is based on HTTP.\n",
      "   This is because HTTP is everywhere. It could not be so pervasive\n",

      "\n",
      "   The HTCPCP protocol is built on top of HTTP, with the addition of a\n",
      "   few new methods, header fields and return codes.  All HTCPCP servers\n",
      "   should be referred to with the \"coffee:\" URI scheme (Section 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1 HTCPCP Added Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1.1 The BREW method, and the use of POST\n",
      "\n",
      "   Commands to control a coffee pot are sent from client to coffee\n",
      "   server using either the BREW or POST method, and a message body with\n",
      "   Content-Type set to \"application/coffee-pot-command\".\n",
      "\n",
      "   A coffee pot server MUST accept both the BREW and POST method\n",
      "   equivalently.  However, the use of POST for causing actions to happen\n",
      "   is deprecated.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Coffee pots heat water using electronic mechanisms, so there is no\n",
      "   fire. Thus, no firewalls are necessary, and firewall control policy\n",
      "   is irrelevant. However, POST may be a trademark for coffee, and so\n",
      "   the BREW method has been added. The BREW method may be used with\n",
      "   other HTTP-based protocols (e.g., the Hyper Text Brewery Control\n",
      "   Protocol).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1.2 GET method\n",
      "\n",
      "   In HTTP, the GET method is used to mean \"retrieve whatever\n",
      "   information (in the form of an entity) identified by the Request-\n",

      "\n",
      "   A robust quality of service is required between the coffee pot user\n",
      "   and the coffee pot service.  Coffee pots SHOULD use the Network Time\n",
      "   Protocol [NTP] to synchronize their clocks to a globally accurate\n",
      "   time standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Telerobotics has been an expensive technology. However, with the\n",
      "   advent of the Cambridge Coffee Pot [CAM], the use of the web (rather\n",
      "   than SNMP) for remote system monitoring and management has been\n",
      "   proven.  Additional coffee pot maintenance tasks might be\n",
      "   accomplished by remote robotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Web data is normally static. Therefore to save data transmission and\n",
      "   time, Web browser programs store each Web page retrieved by a user on\n",
      "   the user's computer. Thus, if the user wants to return to that page,\n",
      "   it is now stored locally and does not need to be requested again from\n",
      "   the server. An image used for robot control or for monitoring a\n",
      "   changing scene is dynamic. A fresh version needs to be retrieved from\n",
      "   the server each time it is accessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.2 Crossing firewalls\n",
      "\n",
      "   In most organizations HTTP traffic crosses firewalls fairly easily.\n",
      "   Modern coffee pots do not use fire. However, a \"firewall\" is useful\n",
      "   for protection of any source from any manner of heat, and not just\n",
